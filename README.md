gRPC Calculator in Golang
This repository contains a simple calculator service implemented using gRPC in Golang. The service currently supports basic addition operations.

Introduction
This project demonstrates the implementation of a gRPC server in Golang, providing a calculator service that can perform addition of two numbers. gRPC is a high-performance, open-source framework that can efficiently connect services in and across data centers with pluggable support for load balancing, tracing, health checking, and authentication.

Prerequisites
Go 1.19 or later installed on your machine.
protoc (Protocol Buffers compiler) installed and added to your PATH.
gRPC and Protocol Buffers Go plugins installed:

go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@latest
go install google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc@latest
Installation
Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/yourusername/grpc-calculator.git
cd grpc-calculator
Compile the Protocol Buffers definition:


protoc --go_out=. --go-grpc_out=. proto/calculator.proto
Build the server:


go build -o server cmd/server/main.go
Build the client:


go build -o client cmd/client/main.go
Usage
Running the Server
Start the gRPC server:
